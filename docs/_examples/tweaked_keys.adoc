how key tweaking can be used.

.Tweaked Keys Example
[source,ruby]
----
include::{sourcedir}/lib/contracts/using_tweaked_keys.rb[tags=tweaked-keys]
----
<1> The same tweak is applied to the public and private keys of the key pair
<2> The tweaked public key is used in the script pubkey
<3> The tweaked private key is then used to sign the transaction

This is availble as notebook when you run `jupyter lab`.
