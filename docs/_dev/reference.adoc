== Variables

Variables being with the `@` symbol and follow expected ruby variable semantics.

== Generating Keys

The simple way to create a new key is to call `key :new` and assign it to a variable.

[source,ruby]
----
@alice = key :new
----

To generate a key using WIF, use the `wif:` keyword.

[source,ruby]
----
@alice = key wif: 'L1Rg5xdVZ9pZqn7s2UreiDxaFP81RHYL2DjFBUP6BfT9QRw8jERR'
----

== Generate Coinbases and Spending Them

The DSL provides a convinient way to mine coins controlled by a key
and then load the coinbase to spend in future transactions.

[source,ruby]
----
@alice = key wif: 'L1Rg5xdVZ9pZqn7s2UreiDxaFP81RHYL2DjFBUP6BfT9QRw8jERR'

# Generate a block with coinbase to Alice's P2WPKH address
extend_chain to: @alice

# Find a spendable coinbase controlled by Alice
@alice_coinbase_tx = spendable_coinbase_for @alice

# Build a transaction spending @tx
...
----

== Transactions

To build a transaction use a `transaction` keyword with two
parameters, `inputs` and `outputs`.

=== Inputs

Inputs parameter to `transaction` takes an array of dictionary
objects. Each dictionary must have the following arguments:

1. `tx`: This is a transaction being spent. It is object obtained by
   building a transaction or querying the node for a transaction.
2. `vout`: This is the output index being spent of the input.
3. `script_sig`: This is the witness script required to spend the UTXO
   identified by the `tx` and `vout`. This script_sig can be defined
   using high level constructs like `p2wpkh`, `sig`, `multisig` or
   simple Bitcoin Script opcodes. This parameter is described in
   detail later.
4. `sighash` (optional, default ALL): The sighash to use when
   generating signatures for the input.
   
=== Outputs

The outputs parameter to `transaction` takes an array of dictionary
objects. Each dictionary object must have the following arguments:

1. `amount`: The amount being spent.
2. `policy` or `descriptor`: The locking script can be specified in two
   ways - miniscript or bitcoin descriptors.
   
A simple transaction that spends the `@alice_coinbase_tx` fetched
above is below. We sign the transaction declaratively by saying
`script_sig: 'p2wpkh:alice'` and generate an output pubkey by saying
`descriptor: 'wpkh(@bob)'`.

[source,ruby]
----
@alice_to_bob = transaction inputs: [
                              { tx: @alice_coinbase_tx, vout: 0, script_sig: 'p2wpkh:alice' }
                            ],
                            outputs: [
                              { descriptor: 'wpkh(@bob)', amount: 49.99.sats }
                            ]
----

== Broadcast and Confirm Transactions

A transaction can be easily broadcast by using the `broadcast`
command. Even though we can use low level JSON-API calls like
`sendrawtransaction`, the DSL provides high level commands to make it
easy to deal with broadcasting and confirming transactions.

[source,ruby]
----
@tx = transaction inputs: [...] outtputs: [...]

broadcast @tx
----

To broadcast multiple transactions list them in the order you want
mempool to accept them. This order is important for certain contracts.

[source,ruby]
----
@tx_a = transaction inputs: [...] outtputs: [...]
@tx_b = transaction inputs: [...] outtputs: [...]

broadcast @tx_b, @tx_a
----

We can confirm transactions by the `confirm` command that mines one
new block. We can optionally provide a key to which the coinbase of
the new block should go to.

[source,ruby]
----
@alice = key :new
@tx = transaction inputs: [...] outtputs: [...]

broadcast @tx
confirm @tx, to: @alice
----

== Node Interaction

The DSL supports all JSON-API commands supported by bitcoin. You don't
need to worry about (de)serialization of arguments. Just provide the
transaction object or any other parameter directly from the DSL. Here
are a few examples:

[source,ruby]
----
@address = ...

# Mine blocks to the address
generatetoaddress num_blocks: 100, to: @address

@tx = ...

# Send raw transaction
sendrawtransaction tx: @tx
----

The complete list of supported commands is the same as [bitcoin's
JSON-API](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/).

The DSL provides abstractions on some of the often used JSON-API
commands to make it easy to talk to bitcoin nodes.

=== Extend Chain

Takes optional public key `to` and number of blocks `num_blocks` to
mine.

If key is provided, the coinbase of all the blocks is created for
P2WPKH of the key.

If key is not provided, `extend_chain` creates a throw away key and
mines blocks using it for the coinbase.

Generates `num_blocks` number of blocks. The default is 1.


[source,ruby]
----
@alice = key :new
@bob = key :new

# Seed alice with some coins
extend_chain to: @alice

# Seed bob with some coins and make coinbase spendable
extend_chain num_blocks: 101, to: @bob
----

=== Find Spendable Coinbase Transactions

To look up a coinbase UTXO controlled by a key use
`spendable_coinbase_for` and provide a key.

The command returns the oldest spendable transaction controlled by the
key as a P2WPKH transaction.

[source,ruby]
----
@tx = spendable_coinbase_for @alice
----

=== Get Chain Height

[source,ruby]
----
get_height
----

=== Get Block at Height

[source,ruby]
----
@block = get_block_at_height 100
----

=== Get Coinbase at Height

[source,ruby]
----
@tx = get_coinbase_at_height 100
----

=== Get TxId for Transaction in Block

[source,ruby]
----
@txid = get_txid block: @block, tx_index: 5
----

== Assertions

The DSL provides a number of assertions for verifying the state of
transactions and chain.

=== Verify Signatures for a Transaction

[source,ruby]
----
verify_signature for_transaction: @alice_tx,
                 at_index: 0,
                 with_prevout: [coinbase_tx, 0]
----

=== Assert Mempool Will Accept a Transaction

[source,ruby]
----
assert_mempool_accept @alice_tx
----

=== Assert Mempool Will Not Accept a Transaction

[source,ruby]
----
assert_not_mempool_accept @alice_tx
----

=== Assert a Transaction is Confirmed

[source,ruby]
----
assert_confirmed transaction: @alice_tx

# Or provide a txid
assert_confirmed txid: @alice_tx.txid
----

=== Assert an Output is (not) Spent

[source,ruby]
----
assert_output_is_spent(transaction: @alice_tx, vout: 0)

assert_output_is_not_spent(transaction: @alice_tx, vout: 0)
----

`assert_confirmed` takes an optional `at_height` parameter to assert
if the transaction has been confirmed in the block at that height.


== Script Interpolation

The DSL provides a number of commands to interpolate in a Script.

=== Signature (sig)

[source,ruby]
----
'sig:(@alice)'
----

The `sig` command generates a signature for the transaction using the
sighash keyword specified in the input. If no sighash keyword is
specified, the DSL uses ALL by default.

=== Hashes

The DSL provides the various hashes that Bitcoin uses.

[source,ruby]
----
'hash160:xxx'
'sha256:xxx'
'double_sha256:xxx'
----
=== Multisig

Since multisig is an often used script, the DSL provides a convinient
way to generate signatures and script required for these.

The script below with generate signatures for the keys specified and
push them to the witness stack.

[source,ruby]
----
'multisig:(@alice,@bob)'
----

=== Interpolated Miniscript Policy

Miniscript is interpolated by replacing all references to variables
and bitcoin hash functions by their corresponding computed hex values.

For example, the policy
`'or(99@thresh(2,pk(@alice),pk(@asp)),and(older(10),pk(@asp_timelock)))'`
is processed by rust-miniscript after `@alice`, `@asp` and
`$asp_timelock` have been replaced by hex formatted public keys.

=== P2WPKH

TODO: Describe this using Descriptors.
