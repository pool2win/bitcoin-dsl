= UHPO Payout Model for Braidpool

. All coinbases are outputs to the currently known threshold
signature pubkey.
. All payouts spend the immediately preceding coinbase and the last
known payout unspent output.
.. There is atleast one output for a payout
.. The first output is the balance for the pool controlled by the
currently known pool key
.. The rest of the outputs are payouts for miners who can spend these
as soon as the payout is confirmed on chain.

== Example

The image image::uhpo.png[] shows an example set of coinbases and
payout transactions.

Each payout has at least one input.


== Challenges

. **Group membership** We need to track the pool membership so that we
can run the threshold signature protocol. Group membership has a
reduction to consensus. Which is a problem.

. **Miner cashouts and Unilateral exits** The protocol requires a
threshold number of miners to agree that a miner is cashing out. A
miner can unilaterally exit only if there is a catastrophic failure.
