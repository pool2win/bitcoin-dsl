== Bitcoin DSL - Mission

Make is easy to experiment with bitcoin contracts.


== Quick Start

The easiest way to run Bitcoin DSL is using the docker image provided
on github.

Install
link:https://github.com/casey/just?tab=readme-ov-file#installation[Just]
and your life will be easier.


.Pull the latest docker image
[source,bash]
----
docker pull
----

.Run a script from terminal
[source,bash]
----
# Run a script using pulled docker image
just run <path-to-your-script>

# Example, running the ARK single payment example
just run ./lib/contracts/ark/single_payment.rb
----

.Run Jupyter notebook
[source,bash]
----
just lab
----

=== Build Docker Image Locally

If you want to buid a docker image locally you can use the just
recipes provided. We build bitcoind from source, so it'll take some
time.

. Build docker image `just dockerize`
. Run local docker image `DSL_IMAGE=local just run <path-to-your-script>`.

== Example Contracts

Here's an example showing setting up keys, looking up coinbase
transactions from bitcoin node, creating new transactions and
confirming them.

.Generate keys and find coinbase to spend
[source,ruby]
----
# Generate new keys
@alice = key :new
@bob = key :new
@carol = key :new

# Seed alice with some coins
extend_chain to: @alice

# Seed bob with some coins and make coinbase spendable
extend_chain num_blocks: 101, to: @bob

assert_equal get_height, 102, 'The height is not correct'

@coinbase_tx = get_coinbase_at 2
----

.Spend coinbase to multisig
[source,ruby]
----
@multisig_tx = transaction inputs: [
     {
       tx: @coinbase_tx,
       vout: 0,
       script_sig: 'sig:wpkh(@bob)'
     }
   ],
   outputs: [
     {
       descriptor: 'wsh(multi(2,@alice,@bob))',
       amount: 49.999.sats
     }
   ]
broadcast @multisig_tx
confirm transaction: @multisig_tx, to: @alice
----

.Spend multisig after signing
[source,ruby]
----
@spend_tx = transaction inputs: [
     {
       tx: @multisig_tx,
       vout: 0,
       script_sig: 'sig:multi(@alice,@bob)'
     }
   ],
   outputs: [
     {
       descriptor: 'wpkh(@carol)',
       amount: 49.998.sats
     }
   ]
broadcast @spend_tx
confirm transaction: @spend_tx, to: @alice
----

== Goals

The goals of the DSL are:

=== Declarative syntax

The DSL will specify what needs to be done, not how it should be
done. For example, to build a transaction, we should just say the
scriptsig is a `sig:wpkh(@bob)` instead of making a series of
imperative calls to achieve the same goal.

=== Execute branches in contract execution

Users should be easily able to run the various branches that a
contract can be executed on.

=== High level language for locking and unlocking Script

Support **miniscript, descriptors and Script** for script sigs and
script pubkeys.

Miniscript and descriptors are handy for writing locking conditions in
a higher level language, however, we also want to write unlocking
scripts in a higher level language.

=== Interact with bitcoin node

All the JSON-RPC API commands will be directly available from
the DSL. This will avoid copy pasting seriaized transactions. The
query results from bitcoin node will be available as objects for
introspection and manipulation.

=== Transparent tracking of signing material

The DSL acts as a god system, where the runtime sees all the
cryptographic material. For example, to generate a P2WSH signature,
the witness program is automatically put in the right place by
the DSL.

== Features

Currently the DSL allows easily doing the following:

. Automatically start/stop a bitcoin node.
. Extend chain to generate coinbases or confirm transactions.
. Build transactions using a high level DSL
   . `script_pub_key` can be specified using miniscript, descriptors
      or Script.
   . `script_sig` can be specified using high level constructs that
      are extensions for descriptors and Script.
. Assert that a transaction will be accepted by mempool.
. Submit bitcoin transactions to a node.
. Query a bitcoin node to assert a transaction is confirmed.
. Query bitcoin node for transactions and blocks - these responses
   are available as objects for further introspection and
   manipulation.

Here's how each of the above is done using the DSL.

== Starting a node

This is automagically handled by the DSL. When you run a DSL script, a
bitcoin node is setup and when the script finishes, the node is
shutdown and all directories are deleted.

There's no commands required to start/stop a node. The DSL just does
it for you.

Here is a simple script to create a coinbase and make it spendable.

[source,ruby]
----
@alice = key :new

# Mine 100 blocks, all with coinbase to alice.
extend_chain to: @alice, num_blocks: 101
----

This is how you run the above script

[source,shell]
----
$ ruby lib/run.rb -s lib/simple.rb
Running script from lib/simple.rb
mkdir -p /tmp/x &&              bitcoind -datadir=/tmp/x -chain=regtest              -rpcuser=test -rpcpassword=test -daemonwait -txindex -debug=1
Bitcoin Core starting
I, [2024-03-01T21:01:13.580365 #73094]  INFO -- : Extending chain by 101 blocks to address bcrt1qy5a0ghjsnmlt4qt0akf7627wkwexljaz6tfame
kill -9 `cat /tmp/x/regtest/bitcoind.pid` && rm -rf /tmp/x
----

As you see above, the DSL automatically starts a new bitcoin node,
runs the script and at the end cleans up by stopping bitcoind and
deleting any data directories.


== Extend chain

We need to extend chain in a number of situations. When we need to
mine some coins to use them later or to confirm a transaction that has
been broadcast.

Let's look at both the cases.

=== Extend chain to mine some coins

The following generates a new key and mines a block where the coinbase
rewards are sent to alice's WKH.

[source,ruby]
----
# Generate new key and call it alice
@alice = key :new

# Extend chain mining coinbases to alice
extend_chain to: @alice
----

=== Extend chain to confirm transactions

The following will mine 100 blocks. This will make all previously
generated coinbases spendable.

[source,ruby]
----
extend_chain num_blocks: 100
----

In the above, we will generate a throw away key that get the coinbase
reward.

== Build transactions

I often need to find a spendable coinbase controlled by a key, then
create a transaction that spends the coinbase, creating a new UTXO
with custom spending conditions.

The following script finds a coinbase spendable by Alice and creates a
new transaction to spend the coinbase.

[source,ruby]
----
# Find a coinbase that Alice can spend
@alice_coinbase = spendable_coinbase_for @alice

transaction inputs: [
     { tx: @alice_coinbase, vout: 0, script_sig: 'wpkh(@alice)' }
   ],
   outputs: [
     { descriptor: 'wpkh(@bob)', amount: 49.99.sats }
   ]
----

Note the syntax to generate `script_sig` and `script_pub_keys`. In the
above transaction:

. `sig:wpkh(@alice)` will sign the transaction knowing it is a p2wpkh
   output owned by Alice.
. `wpkh(@bob)` will create a p2wpkh output for Bob.

We can even use miniscript policies to generate `script_pub_keys` and
I demonstrate that next.

=== Use miniscript policy

If we want to generate a multisig transaction we can use miniscript to
specify the spending policy. Note how the output is now using the
`policy` keyword instead of the `address` keyword. The policy in the
transaction below is a simple 2 of 2 multisig specified using
miniscript.

[source,ruby]
----
transaction inputs: [
     { tx: coinbase_tx, vout: 0, script_sig: 'wpkh(@bob)', sighash: :all}
   ],
   outputs: [
     {
       policy: 'thresh(2,pk(@alice),pk(@bob))',
       amount: 49.999.sats
     }
   ]
----

The `sighash: :all` directive is optional. By default the DSL uses
sighash ALL, but I show this here to point out that we can provide
sighash type here.

We can use any other policy and here's another example with a policy
that requires a spending condition with 2 of 2 multisig or an claim
after a CSV timelock.


[source,ruby]
----
@threshold_tx = transaction inputs: [
     { tx: coinbase_tx, vout: 0, script_sig: 'sig:wpkh(@bob)', sighash: :all }
   ],
   outputs: [
     {
       policy: 'or(99@thresh(2,pk(@alice),pk(@bob)),and(older(10),pk(@bob_timelock)))',
       amount: 49.999.sats
     }
   ]
----

To spend the transaction, we introduce a `csv` keyword. The following
is an example of a transaction spending from the timelock path of the
above transaction.

[source,ruby]
----
transaction inputs: [
     { tx: @threshold_tx,
       vout: 0,
       script_sig: 'sig:@bob_timelock sig:@alice',
       csv: 10 }
   ],
   outputs: [
     {
       descriptor: 'wpkh(@alice)',
       amount: 49.998.sats
     }
   ]
----

Note use of the `CSV` keyword to setup `sequence` and `locktime` values.

We see here how the DSL hides the complications of constructing
bitcoin transactions by providing a high level language to build
transactions.

=== Using descriptors

The transaction above using miniscript `thresh` policy can be written
using the `multi` descriptor instead.

[source,ruby]
----
transaction inputs: [
     { tx: coinbase_tx, vout: 0, script_sig: 'wpkh(@bob)', sighash: :all}
   ],
   outputs: [
     { descriptor: 'wsh(multi(2,@alice,@bob))', amount: 49.999.sats }
   ]
----

=== Using Script

The same script pubkey can also be written using plain old
script. When using `script`, the DSL wraps the provided script into a
`wsh` descriptor for us, and tracks the witness program for use when
we later need to spend from the output.

[source,ruby]
----
transaction inputs: [
     { tx: coinbase_tx, vout: 0, script_sig: 'wpkh(@bob)', sighash: :all}
   ],
   outputs: [
     { script: '2 @alice @bob 2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG', amount: 49.999.sats }
   ]
----




== Bitcoin node interactions

All the part about building transactions is fine. However, the sweet
part is that we can interact with a bitcoin node to submit the
transactions generated and then query the node for the state of the
transactions. In fact, the entire range of json-rpc API for bitcoin is
directly available in the DSL.

In this post, we only focus on the most often used commands and the
abstractions the DSL provides over those.

. Broadcast transactions
. Verify signatures of a transaction
. Assert that the mempool will accept the transaction
. Assert that a certain transaction is confirmed at a certain height

Here's how you do all of the above.

=== Broadcast transactions

[source,ruby]
----
broadcast @alice_bob_multisig_tx
----

=== Verify signatures for a transaction

[source,ruby]
----
verify_signature for_transaction: @alice_bob_multisig_tx,
                 at_index: 0,
                 with_prevout: [coinbase_tx, 0]
----

=== Assert mempool will accept a transaction

[source,ruby]
----
assert_mempool_accept @alice_bob_multisig_tx
----

=== Assert a transaction is confirmed

To assert that a transaction is confirmed at a given height:

[source,ruby]
----
assert_confirmed transaction: @alice_bob_multisig_tx, at_height: 100
----

== Tools Used

I was earlier trying to build an
link:https://github.com/pool2win/bsl[intricate DSL in Lisp], but for
the sake of quick iteration decided to build an internal DSL in
Ruby. Thankfully, we already have an extensive, well tested and
supported library to build bitcoin transactions in Ruby -
link:https://github.com/chaintope/bitcoinrb[bitcoinrb] - a bitcoin ruby
library that provides all the building blocks I need. So my task was
made much simpler - build an internal DSL around bitcoinrb.

I want to leverage miniscript to specify pubscripts. For the same,
link:https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-miniscript[rust-miniscript]
I provide a CLI wrapper around it and call it from within the
Ruby DSL.


== Next Steps

Some of the initial goals for the DSL have already been
accomplished. Namely, an ability to describe transactions in a high
level language and then submit those transactions to a bitcoin node as
well as query the bitcoin node.

Some nice features that I am working on include:

. Abstractions over taproot so that it is easy to build taproot transactions using an abstract DSL.
. Provide highlevel constructs to tweak keys and generate musig and threshold signatures.
